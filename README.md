I looked for datasets and decided to go with the happy countries dataset. In this dataset, countries were given a happiness rank based on parameters like - freedom, generosity, government corruption, and health (life expectancy).

I took the top 20 countires and plotted their standings on the above mentioned factors in the form of bar charts. For the bar charts, I also used color hue as a channel - red to indicate low and green to indicate high.

However, there is a challenge. In case of goverment corruption, red actually means good because a low value for government corruption is a positive indication. But for the other factors, red is a bad sign while green is a good sign.

All the submissions for that challenge are listed in the link below:
